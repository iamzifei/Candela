// its own section, shown only when the current resolution offers more than one.
//
// Split into canvas blocks (docs/panel-resize.md): the header rows, the
// dropdown lists, and the trailing rows are separate PanelBlocks, so opening a
// dropdown animates a clip over content that rendered once at natural height —
// no SwiftUI geometry animates per frame. The shared mutable state (pending
// switches, slider position, smooth-scaling flags) lives in
// DisplayModeController so the sibling blocks stay in sync.

/// Per-display mode-switching state and data, shared by the resolution /
/// refresh-rate blocks of one display section. Created per display when the
/// block list is (re)built; the block hosts retain it.
