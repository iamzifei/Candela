# Building without Xcode

**TL;DR:** run `./dev.sh`, which compiles, swaps the binary into the installed
`/Applications/Crisp.app`, syncs the version from `project.yml`, re-signs, and
relaunches. The rest of this doc explains what it does.

You can build the full .app in Xcode (`xcodegen generate`, then archive), or a
full DMG with `./scripts/release.sh vX.Y.Z` (no Xcode needed). But for the fast
dev loop, the binary alone compiles with just the Command Line Tools:

```sh
swiftc -O -swift-version 5 -strict-concurrency=minimal -parse-as-library \
  -import-objc-header Crisp/Crisp-Bridging-Header.h \
  -framework AppKit -framework SwiftUI -framework IOKit \
  -Xlinker -undefined -Xlinker dynamic_lookup \
  Crisp/App/*.swift Crisp/Models/*.swift Crisp/Services/*.swift \
  Crisp/Views/*.swift Crisp/Utilities/*.swift \
  -o Crisp-bin
```

To run it, swap the binary into an existing Crisp.app install and re-sign ad
hoc:

```sh
pkill -x Crisp
cp Crisp-bin /Applications/Crisp.app/Contents/MacOS/Crisp
xattr -cr /Applications/Crisp.app
codesign --force -s - --entitlements Crisp/Crisp.entitlements /Applications/Crisp.app
open /Applications/Crisp.app
```

This is the fast dev loop: edit, compile, swap, relaunch, no Xcode involved.

## Before opening a PR

Run `make check`: it runs SwiftLint (strict), the unit tests, and the
localization key check, the same checks CI enforces, so failures surface
locally instead of on the PR. It needs full Xcode plus `swiftlint` and
`xcodegen` (`brew install swiftlint xcodegen`). To run it automatically on
every push, opt in once:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The app icon is generated from vector code: `python3 scripts/generate-icon.py`.
It writes the SVG sources to `design/` and rasterises the app iconset into
`Candela/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/` at each final size.
